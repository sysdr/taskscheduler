# Task Scheduler with Dead Letter Queue - Day 26

A comprehensive implementation of the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) pattern integrated with Spring Retry for ultra-scalable task scheduling systems.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Build the application:**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

3. **Run the demo:**
   ```bash
   ./demo.sh
   ```

4. **Verify functionality:**
   ```bash
   ./verify.sh
   ```

5. **Stop the application:**
   ```bash
   ./stop.sh
   ```

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Dead Letter Queue Implementation**: Failed tasks are automatically moved to DLQ after exhausting retries
- **Spring Retry Integration**: Declarative retry configuration with exponential backoff
- **Rich Metadata Storage**: Complete failure context including stack traces and system information
- **Modern Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with professional UI
- **Admin Interface**: Reprocess failed tasks with audit trail
- **Metrics Integration**: Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

- Understanding DLQ pattern for resilient distributed systems
- Integration of Spring Retry with custom recovery logic
- Building operational dashboards for production systems
- Implementing proper error handling and observability

## ðŸ“Š Dashboards

- **Main Dashboard**: http://localhost:8080
- **DLQ Management**: http://localhost:8080/dlq
- **Database Console**: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
- **Metrics Endpoint**: http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics

## ðŸ”§ Architecture

The system implements a comprehensive DLQ pattern with:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queue for permanently failed tasks
- Rich failure classification and metadata
- Reprocessing capabilities with audit trail
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

This implementation demonstrates production-ready error handling patterns essential for building resilient distributed systems.
